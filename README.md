## Jupyter notebook on 'Novellenschatz'
This repository contains the jupyter notebook with code and results for an article on
Paul Heyse's and Hermann Kurz' collection of novellas called 'Novellenschatz' using
methods from stylometry like Delta, PCA and Zeta and network analysis for the
characters.

Be warned:
* The text is in German.
* The code and the text is very raw and unedited. Its only function is to allow those who are interested to delve deeper into what I was doing if they want to know more after reading the essay.
